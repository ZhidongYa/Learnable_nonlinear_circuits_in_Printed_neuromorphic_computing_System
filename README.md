# Learnable_nonlinear_circuits
Learnable nonlinear circuits means, that the components of nonlinear circuits can be automatically optimized with a way of circuit design. What we do is explore an algorithm to build the model for the nonlinear circuit. To do this, the design space of circuit components should be firstly defined. Subsequently, the database that describes how the circuit behavior is established. Finally, an Neural network(NN) is trained as the surrogate model that maps the ralationship from the circuit components to the behavior of the circuit.

# Training
When we obtain the models for the nonlinear circuits, we then integrate them as an NN. We refer to this NN as printed Neural Network(pNN). In this situation, training a pNN means designing a printed neoromorphic circuit. We conduct experiments to study the performance of learnable nonlinear circuits in different consideration.

# Evaluation
For the evaluation there is a set of benchmark datasets. Maybe add standarddeviations as well.  Ideally, it can be seen that the performance of learnable nonlinear circuits improves a lot compare to nonlearnable nonlinear circuits.
